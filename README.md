In this repository, you can find all Do-Files I used for the data treatment, the graphs directly calculated from the dataset in Stata, and the regressions. 
I numbered the Do-Files chronologically in order of the read of the thesis - starting with the data treatment Do-Files, followed by the graph Do-Files and finished by the regression Do-Files. 
As stated in the thesis, I am not allowed to publish the dataset, because of data sensitivity and a signed confidentiality contract.
